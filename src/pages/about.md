## Boss fights

Boss fights are the main element of the entire gameplay. You can manage
them using an in-world UI in the center of the arena. To summon a boss, you
need 10 amethyst. Put it into a special bedrock storage and click "battle".

| ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/fight1.png) | ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/fight2.png) |

To get access to the artefact, you need to defeat a boss 3 times. Every battle activation requires 10 amethyst.
Every boss appears in 3 phases: I, II and III. They are marked in the arena UI and as the part of a boss nick.
After defeating boss in one phase, you will upgrade your arena to the next. When you defeat boss in phase III,
you will get access to the artefact. Boss gains more hp every phase and it has access to more types of attacks.
When you are about to die or you can't defeat an activated boss in time, you can always give up. Do
that by pressing "escape" button and clicking "Give Up". The battle will end, but you will lose your amethyst.

## Artefacts

Artefacts are the most powerful items in the universe. They give you
some special powers, when you wear them. You can obtain them by defeating bosses.
Every boss gives you a specified artefact. After defeating boss in phase III, there
will appear an asteroid with the artefact instead of battle menu in the center of arena.
You can pick it up like other items and then move it to a special artefact slot using button "SET".

## Datapacks

Datapacks allow you to customize your gameplay in the specified universe. You can select a datapack, which will be used
when creating an universe in game settings. Just click on the button "DEFAULT" and select your datapack from your file selector.
You can reset your loaded datapack to default using "X" button.

| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/datapack3.png) | ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/datapack4.png) |

You can create your own datapack or download it from someone else. There is
a default datapack copy in Datapacks folder, so you can copy and edit it. More
info about the jse3 format (SE3 datapack format) in [SE3 documentation](../Documentation).
It might be required to use a professional text editor like Notepad++ or Visual Studio to access
datapack content.  

To use a datapack on your server just swap the Datapack.jse3 file in your server folder with a datapack,
which you want to use. Be sure, that ServerUniverse folder doesn't exist. Remember to change datapack name to "Datapack.jse3".

- You can't change datapack of the universe after it is created.  
- Universes with custom datapack will have "Custom data" subtitle.  
- Universes with custom datapack can't be easily updated to newer versions.
