They allow you to make your spaceship better and stronger.

| ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/upgrades3.png) |
| ----------------------------------------------- |

| Upgrade  | Description                                   |

## Backpack

Backpack is present in the right UI segment. To unlock it, at least one backpack [upgrade](#upgrades) is needed.
Backpack contains the [artefact](#artefacts) slot too, which is always unlocked.

| ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/backpack3.png) |

| ----------------------------------------------- |

## Health

but you can use some [potions](#potions) to regain part of it instantly.

| ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/crash1.png) | ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/crash2.png) |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

Exploding will result in losing all of your items and upgrades. It can be prevented by having keep inventory
enabled or playing more carefully.

| ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/respawn.png) |
| --------------------------------------------- |

## Storages

Using LMB and RMB you will be able to transfer items between storage and your inventory.

| ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/storages.png) |
| ---------------------------------------------- |

## Bullets

Bullets are commonly used to deal damage. There are currently 5 types of them
available for player use. Damage presented in the table can be increased through [upgrades](#upgrades).

## Navigation

The universe in SE3 is procedurally generated, which means that it feels infinite.
There are some features that can help you know where you are. A compass between the health
and turbo bar points you to a respawn point. When you click it, it will display coordinates.

## Boss fights

To summon a boss, put 10 amethyst into a special bedrock storage in the center of any arena and click `BATTLE`.
You need to dodge boss attacks and attack it with your own bullets.

:::tip
Small amethyst pieces will grow into larger ones if left on the amethyst asteroid.

If for some reason you want to
stop the battle, you can resign by pressing `escape` and clicking button `Give Up`. However, this way you will
waste your amethyst.

| -------------------------------------------- |

After defeating a boss three times (boss becomes harder every time you defeat it),
you will be granted with one [artefact](#artefacts), which
you can wear and get some special powers. There are currently 5 types of bosses.
Every one of them is presented in the table below.

| ID  | Boss        | Image                                       | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Protector   | ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/boss1.png) | There are gosspis, that it is Protector, which is regularly seen on Earth. Anyway, it's just a regular UFO, nothing too spectacular... right? |
| 2   | Adecodron   | ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/boss2.png) | It's neither the machine, nor the alien, but it's certainly very dangerous with its spikes, poisonous attacks and the very high speed.        |
| 3   | Octogone    | ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/boss3.png) | The giant octopus-like monster from the other dimension. However, this creature really dislikes being called a space octopus.                 |
| 4   | Starandus   | ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/boss4.png) | The machine so advanced, that it was able to compress a star and use the nuclear fusion as the unlimited source of power.                     |
| 6   | Degenerator | ![SE3_image](../../static/img/ab/boss6.png) | It is said, that Degenerator is actually the evil version of Protector, but nobody knows how it exactly became such.                          |

## Artefacts

Artefacts give you some special powers when you wear them.
Every boss drops a specific one after it is defeated three times.
You can pick up the artefact and move it into a special slot using button `SET`.

| Icon                                          | Artefact    | Boss        | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![SE3_image](../../static/img/items/Nn42.png) | Protection  | Protector   | The super health bar upgrade. It improves your health by 25%, speeds up health regeneration by 50% and reduces health regeneration cooldown by half. |
| ![SE3_image](../../static/img/items/Nn43.png) | Impulse     | Adecodron   | Allows you to make impulses, when you have enough power. You can use it for attack, defense or just for fun.                                         |
| ![SE3_image](../../static/img/items/Nn44.png) | Illusion    | Octogone    | Allows you to become invisible to bosses and other players. It makes you 20% faster and immune to crash damage when active.                          |
| ![SE3_image](../../static/img/items/Nn45.png) | Immortality | Starandus   | When you wear it and die, you won't die, but your artefact will turn gray. Recharge it by exposing it to star wind.                                  |
| ![SE3_image](../../static/img/items/Nn47.png) | Unstable    | Degenerator | That's a mystery. All ancient notes were lost. Figure it out by yourself, but do not kill anyone by accident.                                        |
