# About SE3

Space Eternity 3 is a PC game created by Kamiloso from Poland in Unity. That's the best SE project.  
It was called "Sondy Eksploracji 3" (Exploration Probes 3) at the beginning, but because of file extension se3 the name must have been changed.

It's a sandbox game, where you fly between asteroids, collect or craft items, upgrade your spaceship and fight bosses in future versions.  
You can also create datapacks and play with friends using multiplayer mode. Don't forget to test artefacts, but before, you have to find them. Good luck and have a nice game!
