-   Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
-   Go to the server directory (with `index.js`).

## Running server on Linux

Prerequisites:

-   Git
-   Node.js

Go to the directory where you want to create your server and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Space-Eternity-3/SE3-Server.git
cd SE3-Server
npm i
npm start
```

## Joining to your server

When you start your server, it will be visible for computers in your local network (LAN) on port 27683. You can type in the SE3 address
field `ws://local.ip:27683` or `ws://local.ip:`, where local.ip is your local IP address, for example `192.168.0.10`. 

To join to your server from internet, you need to forward port 27683 on your router. Read more on [portforward.com](https://portforward.com).
Then you need to check your public IP address on [whatismyip.com](https://whatismyip.com). When you forward a port, everyone can join to your
server using address `ws://public.ip:27683` or `ws://public.ip:`, where public.ip is your public IP address.

If you can't for some reason forward ports, you can use page [playit.gg](https://playit.gg) to tunell TCP traffic through the external server with ports already forwarded.
Note, that this way you will increase your server's ping.
