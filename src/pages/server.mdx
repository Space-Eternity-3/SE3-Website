## Running server on Linux

Prerequisites:

-   Git
-   Node.js

Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Space-Eternity-3/SE3-Server.git
cd SE3-Server
npm i
npm start
```

## Joining to your server

If you want to join from the localhost, enter
`ws://localhost:port` in the server address field.
If you replace port with empty string (do not remove `:`), the port will be set to 27683 (the default SE3 port).
You can also change the port in config to not be 27683.

If you want to join from a local network, enter the local IP of
the server host, for example: `ws://192.168.0.10:port`.

If you want to join from internet, it might be a bit more complicated.
You need your public IP address. You can find it by searching
`What is my IP?` in Google. Then you have to set port-forwarding
on your router to redirect every connection on the specified port to your local computer.
You can see all instructions here: [portforward.com](https://portforward.com/router.htm). It might in some cases
require contacting with your internet provider. When it is ready, connect to
a server using your public IP address for example by entering `ws://123.45.67.89:`.

There are some alternatives if you can't use port-forwarding. You can find a free node.js
hosting for example replit.com and run your server on it. (Replit servers
are in San Francisco, which can cause some ping problems if you are away from that place).
You can also use third-party proxy servers like Hamachi.
