Hello again, today I'm publishing a very small update "Beta 2.2b".
Here are all changes:

- Star brightness reduced from 3.5 to 2.5.
- Geyzer volume reduced from 0.25 to 0.16.
- Fixed bug, which was causing screen refreshing every time R was pressed.
- Chat is now positioned correctly on other than 16:9 screen ratios.
- Player on singleplayer could use items while having keep inventory enabled and not living.
- Messages from previous server connection could execute on the next opened universe.
- Asteroids hidden through seon still had their SC_stuck colliders active, which could prevent players from interacting with some fobs.

Additionally, I reuploaded the server to fix some bugs:

- Drill anti-cheat could prevent players from drilling in asteroid variants other than default.
- Bosbul colliders weren't updating when new asteroids were generating.

Thank you for your attention and see you next time! (I hope in 2.3)
